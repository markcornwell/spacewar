Javascript implementation of 1962 game Spacewar! originally developed for the PDP-1

_Background_

This project is a multiplayer version of the first true computer video game, Spacewar!
The game was developed for the PDP-1 and represents a major milestone in the evolution of
computer games.  Our interpretation here tries to be true to the gameplay of that original
game.  We want to re-create the experience of that early game, but deliver it over the internet
so that players around the world can experience the immediacy of playing other human beings in
a game of skill and cunning.

_Game Play_

The game is simple.  Two spaceships orbit a central star (or black hole).  The ships move
in a flat 2D space.Each ship is gyro stabilized and can rotate right or left.  Each has a
rocket they can burn to generate force in the direction they are pointing.  Each has missiles
that fire forward from the nose of the ship.  The object of the game is to destroy the opposing
ship.  Ships can be destroyed by hitting missiles (their opponents or their own) or by moving
too close to the sun, which exerts a gravitational force on the ships.

That is about it.  A simple game.
